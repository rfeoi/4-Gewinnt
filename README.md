# 4-Gewinnt
4 connect in Java

## Why
My uncle is color-blind and he couldn't see the difference between player 1 and 2.
Then I started to make this, so he could play it properly.
This is why I made v1

## Why v2 and what is it?
I made version 2 because I wanted to improve this project.
In Version 2 you could play easier (+ you can play with keys).
I added an "computer", you can play against it.

## Special Thanks go out to
- My uncle, who gave me the idea for this project
- <a href="https://github.com/strifel">Strifel</a> for helping me when I had a problem that I couldn't solve.
